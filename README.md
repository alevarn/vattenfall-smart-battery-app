# A visualization system for a battery located at Boliden Bergsöe

This project work was done on behalf of the Swedish energy company Vattenfall AB. 
Vattenfall wanted a visualization system for a specific battery located at the industrial site Boliden Bergsöe. 
The developed visualization system is a web application that fetches data from a server and visualizes this data. 
A demo of this visualization system can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uur9ZTlnnuI&ab_channel=MarcusA).
